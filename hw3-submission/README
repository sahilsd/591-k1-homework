Key points:

1) TripAdvisor prompts a login page when selenium spawns a new session. Therefore I had to stick to standard http
requests in order to parse reviews and traveler ratings/types. 
This method is very slow since most of the time is consumed in waiting for html pages.

2) This is why, I have attached two files omni-scrapte-out.dat and travel-rating.dat along with already provided
rating-summary.dat with my submission. To avoid replacing these files, I have renamed newly generated file name to
omni-scrapte-out-NEWFILE.dat.

3) Results of linear and logistic regression seemed vague when I used all the parameters. Therefore I have added an
additional run with different set of attributes. I'm sure there will be better sets of attributes that will give more
intuitive model coeffs. 

More implementation details in comments.
