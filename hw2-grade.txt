Q1. (review score comparison) :         15/20 (lexicon not stemmed, cannot compare stemmed review tokens with unstemmed lexicon)
Q2. (visualization and analysis) :      10/10
Q3. (clustering) :                      25/30 (culinary districts shouldnot be overlapping as each district denotes the popular
                                                cuisine of that particular dist., seems like your implementation is clustering mainly
                                                based on cusine, without giving appropriate importance to geolocation, hence spread out
                                                overlapping clusters)
Q4. (cluster visualization) :           10/15 (missing cluster labels)
Q5. (outlier detection) :               15/15
Q6. (analysis) :                        10/10
