Submitting homework1 for 591-k1. 
Because of the large datasize of csv files, the upload fails. Also, there is no significant difference in the compressed
csv files.


Please execute the fastParse() function completely. It takes around 28 min on my laptop, as shown in the time logs in
sample execution. 
Please use the tar.gz subset for oroginal data.

For smaller datasets, please use the two subsets of csv files I am uploading. 
In this case, PLEASE REMOVE THE '.subset' EXTENSION OF THESE FILES BEFORE USE.

I couldn't find any other way to push the csv files. I am generating two csv files simultaneously for question and
answer posts. These files are used later for further processing.
